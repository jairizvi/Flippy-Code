Won third place in a hackathon out of 150 people, where we had 48 hours to make a project that adhered to the theme “Improving the lives of artists”. I created Flippy, a website for iPad where users can upload sheet music. Flippy recognizes the last notes on the page and automatically flips to the next page when users play those notes on their instrument. The idea behind this app was to eliminate the hassle of the user having to flip the page. Here is the link to the video that we submitted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FXDtTWLg8](url)
